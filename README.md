# Interactive menu with QR code order summary

## Project purpose and goal
This is a React app that displays an interactive restaurant food menu. The idea behind this is for the customer to access the app via a QR code from outside the restaurant. They can then choose which items they want to order while waiting in line or in their own time. After completing their order, a QR code is generated on their phone screen so that they can present it to the cashier. The cashier scans the QR code to view the summary of what the customer wants. The cashier can then punch the items into the POS to finalize the order. It has an administrative side so that the restaurant can add, edit, remove or reorder the menu on their own.
